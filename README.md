### I am Full Stack Engineer
Hi, I'm [Abdelmejid](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amejid/), a passionate self-taught full stack web developer and a software engineer from Ethiopia. My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. i take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

I'm a student of Microverse, i am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. I learned a lot from the open-source community and i love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source and learning new skills. HAPPY CODING
